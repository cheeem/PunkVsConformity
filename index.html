              <p> 
                Emerging in the mid 1970s, punk rock quickly identified itself as a polarizing genre. 
                A reaction to the commercialization of rock, punk rose as a subculture that rejected the sterilized product the rock had become. 
              </p>
              <p>
                From its debut, punk rock was sloppy and simple. Anyone could play; all that seperated you from the artist was dedication.

              <p>
                An evolution of the Straight Edge manifesto, Revolution Summer promoted veganism and non-violence in punk, discouraging moshing - a defining element of live hardcore.

              <p> 
                The movement is also credited with the rise of emotional hardcore, producing bands such as Rites of Spring and Embrace.

                As a new generation of young blood found itself injected into punk's veins with the turn of the decade, the genre soon found itself at a crossroads, both sonically and socially.

              <p> 
                Therefore, with the rise of the 1990s brought with it an onslaught of new musical evolutions as the genre sought both invited crossover and matured, and social movements seeking to break free of the pre-established dogmas that permeated the hardcore punk.

                During their height in the 1980s, punk and metal stood as factions seperated by a hateful feud.
                An intermixing of the two was sure to leave no one happy.

              <p>
                With the release of Suicidal Tendencies' self titled LP, a bridge between the two sworn enemies began to form - a rebellion against punk's own anti-metal dogma. By the 1990s, metalcore solidied itself as the dominant subgenre in hardcore, a title it holds to this day.

                Rooted in the rise of 3rd wave feminism, Riot Grrrl sought not only to give voice to victims of sexual abuse and challenge the institutions that attempted to silence them, but to bring female faces to a male-dominated punk scene.
